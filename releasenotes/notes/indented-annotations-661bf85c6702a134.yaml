features:
  - |
    Annotations and pragmas that are indented will now tokenise correctly, without including the
    leading whitespace of the line.
fixes:
  - |
    The free-form payloads of annotations and pragmas will now no longer include preceding spaces
    that only separate the payload from the annotation/pragma keywords.
  - |
    Indented annotations and pragmas will now more reliably tokenise correctly; previously, they
    were highly sensitive to whitespace on the preceding lines.
other:
  - |
    Whitespace tokens now split after newlines, except if the following character is also a newline
    character.  This is so that newline-sensitive tokenisation like annotations and pragmas can
    match correctly.
